    <h2>Description</h2>
    Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a favorite around the world. It is a hearty and satisfying meal known for its layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich fillings. Traditionally, these layers include a savory meat sauce, typically made with ground beef or sausage simmered in a tomato-based sauce, and a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture. Mozzarella cheese is often added between the layers and on top to create a melty, golden-brown crust when baked. The meat sauce, often referred to as ragù or Bolognese, is usually flavored with onions, garlic, herbs such as basil and oregano, and sometimes red wine for depth of flavor. The cheese layer provides a creamy contrast, with ricotta or béchamel adding richness, while Parmesan cheese is often sprinkled on top for a sharp, nutty finish. The dish is assembled by layering the pasta sheets with the meat sauce and cheese mixture, repeating these layers to fill a deep baking dish. It is then baked until the top is bubbly and golden, and the layers meld together into a cohesive, flavorful casserole. Lasagna can be customized with various ingredients, such as vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, or different types of cheese. Vegetarian versions might replace the meat with hearty vegetables or plant-based proteins. Regardless of the specific ingredients, lasagna remains a comforting, indulgent dish, perfect for gatherings or a cozy family meal.

      <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-By-Step Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
      <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
      <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
