    <h2>Description</h2>
    Chicken shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish known for its flavorful and aromatic marinated chicken, which is typically cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The dish originates from the Levantine region and has gained widespread popularity around the globe. The preparation of chicken shawarma involves marinating thin slices of chicken in a blend of spices and seasonings, which often includes garlic, turmeric, cumin, paprika, coriander, and sometimes cinnamon or allspice. Yogurt or lemon juice is commonly added to the marinade to tenderize the meat and infuse it with a tangy flavor. Once marinated, the chicken is stacked on a vertical spit and slowly roasted, allowing the outside layer to crisp up while remaining juicy inside. As the chicken cooks, thin slices are shaved off and typically served in warm pita bread or flatbread. Chicken shawarma is often accompanied by a variety of toppings and sauces that enhance its taste. Chicken shawarma can also be served as a platter, often accompanied by rice or fries, salad, and additional sauces. The combination of tender, spiced chicken with the fresh and tangy accompaniments makes chicken shawarma a beloved dish that offers a burst of flavors and textures in every bite.
